# 🎆 Particle Text Morph Animation

A cinematic, interactive particle system where thousands of glowing particles form an energy sphere and smoothly morph into dynamic text in real time.

Built using **p5.js** and creative coding techniques to showcase particle systems, motion physics, and text-based animations.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Particles orbit around the center forming an energy sphere.
2. When the user types text:
   - The sphere collapses.
   - Particles dynamically reposition to form the typed text.
3. Clearing the input resets the particles back into the sphere.

The text is converted into particles using pixel-based sampling from an off-screen canvas.
